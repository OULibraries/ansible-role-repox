WIP

This will be an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/ "main Ansible site") [role](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html "playbook roles documentation") that adds [REPOX](https://github.com/europeana/REPOX "REPOX on github") to a machine.

Right now, it's only [the default variables for the role](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html#role-default-variables "Ansible documentation on default variables").

There is a [playbook](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html "Ansible playbook documentation") in another repository, and that playbook will use this role.  Eventually, that playbook will have its guts siphoned into this role.
